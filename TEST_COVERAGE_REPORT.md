# CygnusWealth Test Coverage Report

## Overview
This report summarizes the current testing infrastructure and provides recommendations for improving test coverage.

## Current Testing Setup

### Testing Framework
- **Unit Testing**: Vitest v3.2.4 with React Testing Library
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright v1.54.2
- **Coverage Reporting**: @vitest/coverage-v8

### Test Configuration
- Environment: jsdom
- Coverage thresholds:
  - Branches: 70%
  - Functions: 70%
  - Lines: 80%
  - Statements: 80%

## Unit Test Coverage

### ‚úÖ Well-Tested Components
1. **SES Compatibility** (10 tests) - 100% passing
   - Tests for Secure EcmaScript environment compatibility
   - Date handling with fallbacks
   - Console warning filters

2. **Multi-Wallet Connect** (6 tests) - 100% passing
   - Wallet detection (MetaMask, multiple providers)
   - Account connection with multiple accounts
   - Chain switching functionality

3. **Chakra UI v3 Integration** (4 tests) - 100% passing
   - Validates correct API usage for v3

### üü° Partially Tested Components
1. **useStore** (14 tests) - 50% passing
   - Account management functions need fixes
   - Portfolio update logic needs adjustment
   - Persistence tests failing

2. **Dashboard** (21 tests) - 90% passing
   - Minor issues with pagination tests
   - All core functionality tested

3. **Connections** (17 tests) - 70% passing
   - Issues with DOM queries and mocking
   - Core flows are tested

### ‚ùå Components Needing Tests
1. **SideMenu** - No tests
2. **WalletDetails** - No tests
3. **TokenManager** - No tests
4. **WalletDiagnostics** - No tests
5. **useEvmBalanceWithPublicRpc** - No tests

## E2E Test Coverage

### Created E2E Tests
1. **Portfolio Flow** (`e2e/portfolio-flow.spec.ts`)
   - Dashboard empty state
   - Navigation to connections
   - Sidebar navigation
   - Mobile menu handling
   - Accessibility checks

2. **Wallet Connection** (`e2e/wallet-connection.spec.ts`)
   - Wallet detection with mocked provider
   - Connection flow
   - Account display
   - Disconnection/deletion
   - Portfolio display with assets

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Fix failing unit tests** - Several tests have minor issues that need addressing
2. **Add tests for critical components**:
   - SideMenu (navigation is critical)
   - WalletDetails (displays user assets)
   - useEvmBalanceWithPublicRpc (handles blockchain data)

### Medium Priority
1. **Increase test coverage** for edge cases:
   - Error states
   - Loading states
   - Empty states
   - Network failures

2. **Add integration tests** for:
   - Wallet connection with real providers
   - Multi-chain support
   - Token price fetching

### Low Priority
1. **Visual regression testing** using Playwright screenshots
2. **Performance testing** for large portfolios
3. **Accessibility testing** automation

## Test Commands

```bash
# Unit tests
npm test                # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage   # Run with coverage report
npm run test:ui        # Open Vitest UI

# E2E tests
npm run test:e2e       # Run Playwright tests
npm run test:e2e:ui    # Open Playwright UI
npm run test:e2e:debug # Debug mode
```

## Coverage Goals
- Current estimated coverage: ~60%
- Target coverage: 80%+ for critical paths
- Focus areas: Wallet connections, asset display, state management

## Next Steps
1. Fix the 33 failing unit tests
2. Add missing tests for critical components
3. Run coverage report to identify gaps
4. Set up CI/CD pipeline with test requirements
5. Add pre-commit hooks for test execution
